## LangGraph Exploration

This repository is a personal playground where I am **exploring LangGraph**:

- **Goal**: Learn how to build and orchestrate LLM-powered workflows using LangGraph.
- **Experiments**: Trying out different graph structures, tools, and agent patterns.
- **Status**: Early exploration phase – structure and code will evolve frequently.

## Notes

- This is not a polished production project; it is primarily for learning and experimentation.
- Expect breaking changes, refactors, and messy prototypes as I iterate.

## Future Plans

- Add example LangGraph workflows (agents, tools, and state graphs).
- Document useful patterns and gotchas discovered along the way.
- Potentially extract reusable components into separate modules.
